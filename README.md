Questie-335 updated to work with the Ashen Order repack.




> [!IMPORTANT]
> # Setup / Installation
> - Click the green Code button > Download ZIP.
> - Extract both folders "Questie-335" and "Questie-AshenOrder" to the Interface > Addons folder in your client.
> - The first/initial login after installing the addons will take about a minute to populate the Questie database in-game, which is displayed in the chatbox.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that both "Questie-335" and "Questie-AshenOrder" addon folders must be used together and they will not work properly independently of each other.  This also means you cannot use a Questie-335 from another repository as it will not be compatible with Questie-AshenOrder, so please make sure you use both and only the ones from this repository.
